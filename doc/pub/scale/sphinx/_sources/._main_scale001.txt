.. index:: scaling

.. index:: non-dimensionalization

Scaling is an extremely useful technique in mathematical modeling and
numerical simulation.  The purpose of the technique is three-fold:

1. Make independent and dependent variables dimensionless.

2. Make the size of independent and dependent variables about unity.

3. Reduce the number of independent physical parameters in the model.

.. index:: dimensionless variable

The first and second item mean that for any variable, denote it by
:math:`q`, we introduce a corresponding dimensionless variable

.. math::
         \bar q = \frac{q-q_0}{q_c},

where :math:`q_0` is a reference value of :math:`q` (:math:`q_0=0` is a common choice) and
:math:`q_c` is a characteristic size of :math:`|q|`. Since the numerator and denominator
have the same dimension, :math:`\bar q` becomes a dimensionless number.

If :math:`q_c` is the maximum value of :math:`|q-q_0|`, we see that :math:`0 < |\bar
q|\leq 1`. How to find :math:`q_c` is sometimes the big challenging of
scaling. Examples will illustrate various approaches to meet this
challenge.

The forthcoming text has the following goals.

 * Teach the technical steps of making a mathematical model, based
   on differential equations, dimensionless.

 * Describe various techniques for reasoning about the scales, i.e.,
   finding the characteristic sizes of quantities.

 * Teach how to identify and interpret dimensionless numbers arising
   from the scaling process.

 * Provide a lot of different examples on making models dimensionless
   with physically correct scales.

 * Demonstrate software tools for computing with numbers with units,
   including doing unit conversions.

 * Introduce software tools for creating user interfaces that
   can automatically perform unit conversion.

 * Use symbolic software (SymPy) to derive exact solutions of differential
   equations.

 * Explain how to run a dimensionless model with software developed
   for the problem with dimensions.

.. Topics not covered


.. admonition:: Limited scope

   Literature covering scaling and non-dimensionalization often also discuss
   topics such as deriving functional relationships based on dimensional
   reasoning, as well as dynamic similarity and use of dimensionless groups in
   experimental investigations [Ref1]_ [Ref2]_.
   These topics are not covered herein, because our focus is strictly
   on making models based on differential equations dimensionless.

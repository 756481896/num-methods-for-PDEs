Using classes to implement a simulator
======================================

 * Introduce classes ``Mesh``, ``Function``, ``Problem``, ``Solver``, ``Visualizer``,
   ``File``

.. communicate with compiled code by ensuring that classes work with arrays

.. ===== Callbacks to Python from Fortran or C =====

.. 5631 projects:

.. Drop f_a, call py from f77

.. Call py with cpdef f from Cython, but hardcode function name

.. As above, but transfer function to Cython

.. Instant

.. test_quadratic for all

.. Think of extensions: Neumann with modified stencil or ghost cells,

.. variable coefficients, damping, ...

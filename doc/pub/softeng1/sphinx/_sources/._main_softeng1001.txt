Basic implementations
=====================

.. _softeng1:basic:math:

Mathematical problem and solution technique
-------------------------------------------

We address the perhaps simplest possible differential equation problem

.. _Eq:softeng1:ode:

.. math::
   :label: softeng1:ode
        
        u'(t) = -au(t), \quad t \in (0,T], 
        

.. _Eq:softeng1:u0:

.. math::
   :label: softeng1:u0
          
        u(0)  = I,                         
        

where :math:`a`, :math:`I`, and :math:`T` are prescribed parameters, and :math:`u(t)` is
the unknown function to be estimated. This mathematical model
is relevant for physical phenomena featuring exponential decay
in time, e.g., vertical pressure variation in the atmosphere,
cooling of an object, and radioactive decay.

The time domain is discretized with points :math:`0 = t_0 < t_1 \cdots < t_{N_t}=T`,
here with a constant spacing :math:`\Delta t` between the
mesh points: :math:`\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}`, :math:`n=1,\ldots,N_t`. Let
:math:`u^n` be the numerical approximation to the exact solution at :math:`t_n`.
A family of popular numerical methods can be written in the form

.. _Eq:softeng1:utheta:

.. math::
   :label: softeng1:utheta
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
        
        

for :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N_t-1`. This numerical scheme corresponds to
the `Forward Euler <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Euler_method>`__
scheme when :math:`\theta=0`,
the `Backward Euler <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_Euler_method>`__
scheme when :math:`\theta=1`,
and the `Crank-Nicolson <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank-Nicolson>`__
scheme when :math:`\theta=1/2`.
The initial condition :eq:`softeng1:u0` is key to start
the recursion with a value for :math:`u^0`.

.. _softeng1:basic:impl1:

A first, quick implementation
-----------------------------

Solving :eq:`softeng1:utheta` in a program is very straightforward:
just make a loop over :math:`n` and evaluate the formula. The :math:`u(t_n`)
values for discrete :math:`n` can be stored in an array. This makes it easy
to also plot the solution. It would be natural to also add
the exact
solution curve :math:`u(t)=Ie^{-at}` to the plot.

Traditionally, a language like Fortran or C would be adopted for
implementation, but the enormous popularity of MATLAB in the
computational science community over the last two decades, makes
a high-level MATLAB-style implementation natural. Below is such
a code, written in Python with a syntax close to MATLAB and with
a programming style heavenly influenced by "MATLAB scripting".
A student or engineer would quickly put together statements like
this:

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        
        A = 1
        a = 2
        T = 4
        dt = 0.2
        N = int(round(T/dt))
        y = zeros(N+1)
        t = linspace(0, T, N+1)
        theta = 1
        y[0] = A
        for n in range(0, N):
            y[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*y[n]
        
        y_e = A*exp(-a*t) - y
        error = y_e - y
        E = sqrt(dt*sum(error**2))
        print 'Norm of the error: %.3E' % E
        plot(t, y, 'r--o')
        t_e = linspace(0, T, 1001)
        y_e = A*exp(-a*t_e)
        plot(t_e, y_e, 'b-')
        legend(['numerical, theta=%g' % theta, 'exact'])
        xlabel('t')
        ylabel('y')
        show()

This program is easy to read, and as long it is correct, many will
claim that it has sufficient quality. Nevertheless, the program suffers
from serious flaws that quickly become crucial for writing correct
programs for more complicated mathematical problems. First we list
two serious bad habits:

1. The notation in the program does not correspond *exactly* to
   the notation in the mathematical problem: the solution is called
   ``y`` and corresponds to :math:`u` in the mathematical description,
   the variable ``A`` corresponds to the mathematical parameter :math:`I`,
   ``N`` in the program is called :math:`N_t` in the mathematics.

2. There are no comments in the program.

.. _softeng1:basic:impl2:

A more decent, flat program
---------------------------

A code with more satisfactory quality arises from
fixing the notation and adding comments:

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        
        I = 1
        a = 2
        T = 4
        dt = 0.2
        Nt = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
        u = zeros(Nt+1)           # array of u[n] values
        t = linspace(0, T, Nt+1)  # time mesh
        theta = 1                 # Backward Euler method
        
        u[0] = I                  # assign initial condition
        for n in range(0, Nt):    # n=0,1,...,Nt-1
            u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
        
        # Compute norm of the error
        u_e = I*exp(-a*t) - u     # exact u at the mesh points
        error = u_e - u
        E = sqrt(dt*sum(error**2))
        print 'Norm of the error: %.3E' % E
        
        # Compare numerical (u) and exact solution (u_e) in a plot
        plot(t, u, 'r--o')               # red dashes w/circles
        t_e = linspace(0, T, 1001)       # very fine mesh for u_e
        u_e = I*exp(-a*t_e)
        plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')             # blue line for u_e
        legend(['numerical, theta=%g' % theta, 'exact'])
        xlabel('t')
        ylabel('u')
        show()

At first sight, this is a good starting point for playing around
with the mathematical problem: we can just change parameters and rerun.
Let us embed the program in an IPython notebook such that we
can get the plot up in the notebook, see Figure :ref:`softeng1:ipynb`.

.. _softeng1:ipynb:

.. figure:: ipynb_flat.png
   :width: 700

   *Flat experimental code in a notebook*

Although such an interactive session is good for initial exploration,
one will soon extend the experiments and start developing the code
further. Say we want to compare :math:`\theta =0,1,0.5` in the same
plot. This extension requires changes all over the code and quickly
lead to errors. To do something serious with this program we have to
break it into smaller pieces and make sure each piece is well tested,
is general, and can be reused in new contexts without changes.  The
next natural step is therefore to isolate the numerical computations
and the visualization in separate functions.

.. _softeng1:basic:func:

Implementing the numerical algorithm in a function
--------------------------------------------------

The solution formula :eq:`softeng1:utheta` is completely general and
should be available as a Python function ``solver`` with all input data as
function arguments and all output data returned to the calling code.
With this ``solver`` function we can then solve all types of problems
:eq:`softeng1:ode`-:eq:`softeng1:u0`
by an easy-to-read one-line statement:

.. code-block:: python

        u, t = solver(I=1, a=2, T=4, dt=0.2, theta=0.5)

The implementation of the ``solver`` function in Python goes like this:

.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
            dt = float(dt)               # avoid integer division
            Nt = int(round(T/dt))        # no of time intervals
            T = Nt*dt                    # adjust T to fit time step dt
            u = np.zeros(Nt+1)           # array of u[n] values
            t = np.linspace(0, T, Nt+1)  # time mesh
        
            u[0] = I                  # assign initial condition
            for n in range(0, Nt):    # n=0,1,...,Nt-1
                u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
            return u, t


.. admonition:: Tip: Always use a doc string to document a function

   Python has a convention for documenting the purpose and usage of
   a function in a *doc string*: simply place the documentation
   in a one- or multi-line triple-quoted string right after the
   function header.





.. admonition:: Be careful with unintended integer division

   Note that we in the ``solver`` function explicitly covert ``dt`` to a
   ``float`` object. If not, the updating formula for ``u[n+1]`` may evaluate
   to zero because of integer division when ``theta``, ``a``, and ``dt`` are integers!




One of the most serious flaws in computational work is to have several
slightly different implementations of the same computational algorithms
lying around in various program files. This is very likely to happen,
because busy scientists often want to test a slight variation of a code to see
what happens. A quick copy and edit do the task, but such quick hacks have
a tendency to survive. When a real correction is needed in the implementation,
it is difficult to ensure that the correction is done in all relevant files.
In fact, this is a general problem in programming, which has led to
an important principle.


.. admonition:: The DRY principle: Don't repeat yourself

   When implementing a particular functionality in a computer program, make sure
   this functionality and its variations are implemented in just one piece
   of code. That is, if you need to revise the implementation, there should be
   *one and only one* place to edit. It follows that you should never
   duplicate code (don't repeat yourself!), and code snippets that are
   similar should be factored into one piece (function) and parameterized (by
   function arguments).




.. _softeng1:basic:module:

Making a module
---------------

As soon as you start making Python functions in a program, you should
make sure the program file fulfills the requirement of a module.
This means that you can import and reuse your functions in other
programs too. For example, if our ``solver`` function resides in a
module ``decay`` in a module file ``decay.py``, we can in any program
do

.. code-block:: python

        from decay import solver
        u, t = solver(I=1, a=2, T=4, dt=0.2, theta=0.5)

or prefix function names by the module name:

.. code-block:: python

        import decay
        u, t = decay.solver(I=1, a=2, T=4, dt=0.2, theta=0.5)

The requirements for a program to qualify for a module are simple:

1. The filename without ``.py`` must be a valid Python variable name.

2. The main program must be executed (through statements or
   a function call) in the *test block*.

The *test block* is normally placed at the end of a module file:

.. code-block:: python

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            # Statements

When the module file is executed as a stand-alone program, the if test
is true and the indented statements are run, but when the module file
is imported, ``__name__`` equals the module name and the test block
is not executed.

To explain the importance of the test block, consider the trivial module
file ``hello.py`` with one function and a call to this function as main program:

.. code-block:: python

        def hello(arg='World!'):
            print 'Hello, ' + arg
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            hello()

Without the test block,

.. code-block:: python

        def hello(arg='World!'):
            print 'Hello, ' + arg
        
        hello()

any attempt to import ``hello`` will also execute the call ``hello()`` and
hence write `Hello, World!' to the screen.
Such output is not desired when importing a module! However,
with the test block, ``hello()`` is not called during import, but
running the file as ``python hello.py`` will make the block active
and lead to the desired printing.


.. admonition:: All coming functions are placed in a module

   The many functions to be explained in the following text are
   put in one module file `decay.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/softeng1/decay.py>`__.




What more than the ``solver`` function is needed in our ``decay`` module
to do everything we did in the previous, flat program?
We need import statements for ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib`` as well as
another function for producing the plot. It can also be convenient
to put the exact solution in a Python function.
Our module ``decay.py`` then looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        
        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            ...
        
        def exact_solution(t, I, a):
            return I*exp(-a*t)
        
        def experiment_compare_numerical_and_exact():
            I = 1;  a = 2;  T = 4;  dt = 0.4;  theta = 1
            u, t = solver(I, a, T, dt, theta)
        
            t_e = linspace(0, T, 1001)       # very fine mesh for u_e
            u_e = exact_solution(t_e, I, a)
        
            plot(t,   u,   'r--o')           # dashed red line with circles
            plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')             # blue line for u_e
            legend(['numerical, theta=%g' % theta, 'exact'])
            xlabel('t')
            ylabel('u')
            plotfile = 'tmp'
            savefig(plotfile + '.png');  savefig(plotfile + '.pdf')
        
            error = exact_solution(t, I, a) - u
            E = sqrt(dt*sum(error**2))
            print 'Error norm:', E
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            experiment_compare_numerical_and_exact()

This module file does exactly the same as the previous, flat program,
but it becomes much easier to extend the code with other plots or
experiments in new functions.  And even more important, the numerical
algorithm is coded and tested once and for all in the ``solver``
function, and any need to solve the mathematical problem is a matter
of one function call.

.. (not copying initialization statements and a loop

.. to a new program for ad hoc editing!).

.. _softeng1:basic:modprefix:

Prefixing imported functions by the module name
-----------------------------------------------

.. index:: importing modules

Import statements of the form ``from module import *`` import
functions and variables in ``module.py`` into the current file.
For example, when doing

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *

we get mathematical functions like ``sin`` and ``exp``
as well as MATLAB-style functions like ``linspace`` and ``plot``,
which can be called by these well-known names.
Unfortunately, it sometimes becomes confusing to
know where a particular function comes from. Is it from ``numpy``? Or
``matplotlib.pyplot``?
Or is it our own function?

An alternative import is

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy
        import matplotlib.pyplot

and such imports require functions to be prefixed by the module name, e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

        t = numpy.linspace(0, T, Nt+1)
        u_e = I*numpy.exp(-a*t)
        matplotlib.pyplot.plot(t, u_e)

This is normally regarded as a better habit because it is explicitly stated
from which module a function comes from.

The modules ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib.pyplot`` are so frequently used,
and their full names quite tedious to write, so two standard abbreviations
have evolved in the Python scientific computing community:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        t = np.linspace(0, T, Nt+1)
        u_e = I*np.exp(-a*t)
        plt.plot(t, u_e)

The downside of prefixing functions by the module name is that
mathematical expressions like :math:`e^{-at}\sin(2\pi t)` get
cluttered with module names,

.. code-block:: python

        numpy.exp(-a*t)*numpy.sin(2(numpy.pi*t)
        # or
        np.exp(-a*t)*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)

Such an expression looks like ``exp(-a*t)*sin(2*pi*t)`` in most
other programming languages. Similarly,
``np.linspace`` and ``plt.plot`` look less familiar to people who are
used to MATLAB and who have not adopted Python's prefix style.
Whether to do ``from module import *`` or ``import module`` depends
on personal taste and the problem at hand. In these writings we use
``from module import`` in more basic, shorter programs where similarity with
MATLAB could be an advantage. Prefix of mathematical
functions in formulas is something we often avoid to obtain
a one-to-one correspondence between
mathematical formulas and the Python code.

Our ``decay`` module can be edited to use the module prefix for
``matplotlib.pyplot`` and ``numpy``:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            ...
        
        def exact_solution(t, I, a):
            return I*np.exp(-a*t)
        
        def experiment_compare_numerical_and_exact():
            I = 1;  a = 2;  T = 4;  dt = 0.4;  theta = 1
            u, t = solver(I, a, T, dt, theta)
        
            t_e = np.linspace(0, T, 1001)       # very fine mesh for u_e
            u_e = exact_solution(t_e, I, a)
        
            plt.plot(t,   u,   'r--o')       # dashed red line with circles
            plt.plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')         # blue line for u_e
            plt.legend(['numerical, theta=%g' % theta, 'exact'])
            plt.xlabel('t')
            plt.ylabel('u')
            plotfile = 'tmp'
            plt.savefig(plotfile + '.png');  plt.savefig(plotfile + '.pdf')
        
            error = exact_solution(t, I, a) - u
            E = np.sqrt(dt*np.sum(error**2))
            print 'Error norm:', E
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            experiment_compare_numerical_and_exact()

We remark that some would prefer to get rid of the prefix in
mathematical formulas:

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import exp, sum, sqrt
        
        def exact_solution(t, I, a):
            return I*exp(-a*t)
        
        error = exact_solution(t, I, a) - u
        E = sqrt(dt*sum(error**2))

.. _softeng1:basic:experiment2:

Comparing numerical schemes in one plot
---------------------------------------

Let us specifically demonstrate one extension of the
flat program in the section :ref:`softeng1:basic:impl1`
that would require substantial editing of the flat code, while
in a structured module, we can simply add a new function without
affecting the existing code and with reusing the implementation
of the numerics.

Our aim is to make a comparison between the numerical solutions
for various schemes (:math:`\theta` values) and the exact solution:

.. figure:: compare.png
   :width: 600


.. admonition:: Stop a minute

   Look at the flat program in
   the section :ref:`softeng1:basic:impl1`,
   and try to imagine which edits that are required to solve this new problem.




With the ``solver`` function at hand, we can simply create a function
with a loop over ``theta`` values and add the necessary plot statements:

.. code-block:: python

        def experiment_compare_schemes():
            """Compare theta=0,1,0.5 in the same plot."""
            I = 1;  a = 2;  T = 4;  dt = 0.4
            legends = []
            for theta in [0, 1, 0.5]:
                u, t = solver(I, a, T, dt, theta)
                plt.plot(t, u, '--o')            # dashed lines with circles
                legends.append('theta=%g' % theta)
            t_e = np.linspace(0, T, 1001)       # very fine mesh for u_e
            u_e = exact_solution(t_e, I, a)
            plt.plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')             # blue line for u_e
            legends.append('exact')
            plt.legend(legends, loc='upper right')
            plotfile = 'tmp'
            plt.savefig(plotfile + '.png');  plt.savefig(plotfile + '.pdf')

A call to this ``experiment_compare_schemes`` function must be placed
in the test block, or you can run the program from IPython instead:

.. code-block:: ipy

        In[1]: from decay import *
        
        In[2]: experiment_compare_schemes()

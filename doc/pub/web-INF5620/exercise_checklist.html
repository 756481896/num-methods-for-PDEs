<p>
Students will in groups of three (or two) perform peer review, i.e.,
assess other students' exercises.
The review is written to a
file called <code>FEEDBACK.txt</code>, located in the student's exercise directory.
Below is a checklist of points to consider when writing a review.

<p>
For a program:

<ol>
<li> Are the files easy to locate? That is, does the directory has a logical
   name? Are individual files given names according to the exercise?</li>
<li> Is the program easy to read? More specifically,</li>

<ol>
 <li> Are variables given self-explanatory names or names in accordance
    of the mathematical description?</li>
 <li> Are enough comments in the code?</li>
 <li> Is the code well formatted (use of whitespace etc.)?</li>
 <li> Is the code well organized in terms of functions or classes?
    (Also consider overuse of functions and classes in simpler problems!)</li>
</ol>

<li> Does the program answer the various points in the exercise?</li>
<li> Does the program work?</li>
<li> Are there any (automatic) verifications of the code?</li>
<li> Are you able to run the code?</li>
</ol>

For a report:

<ol>
<li> Is the report easy to locate?</li>
<li> Is the report well formatted (title, author, sections, paragraphs,
   right spacings, low amount of typos, nice layout, introduction,
   conclusions, etc.)?</li>
<li> Is the text logic and easy to follow? Is there sufficient explanation of
   what is done?</li>
<li> Are the results correct?</li>
<li> Are there any verifications of the results?</li>
</ol>

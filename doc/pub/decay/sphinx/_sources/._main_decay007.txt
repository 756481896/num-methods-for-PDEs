Exercise 32: Characterize a finite difference
---------------------------------------------

.. --- previous heading type: exercise



.. begin quiz



**Question:** We can approximate the derivative at a point using two function values:

.. figure:: fd_forward.png
   :width: 400

What is this type of difference called and how large is the error?


**Choice A:** This is a centered difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t^2`. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (No, a centered difference would have the two function values equally displaced to either side of the target point t_n.)`

**Choice B:** This is a forward difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t`. :abbr:`? (Right!)` :abbr:`# (The name is forward difference, or Forward Euler difference in the context of differential equations. In such contexts the formula is also known as Euler's method or formula.)`

**Choice C:** This is a Forward Euler difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t^3`. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (One may well call this a Forward Euler difference, but the error is not as "good" as \Delta t^3.)`

**Choice D:** This is a Backward Euler finite difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t`. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (Since we use the points t_{n+1} and t_n when constructing the difference, we go *forward* in time, not backward. Therefore, this is a forward difference.)`

Exercise 33: Characterize a finite difference
---------------------------------------------

.. --- previous heading type: exercise



.. begin quiz



**Question:** We can approximate the derivative at a point using two function values:

.. figure:: fd_centered_CN.png
   :width: 400

What is this type of difference called and how large is the error?


**Choice A:** This is a centered difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t^2`. :abbr:`? (Right!)`

**Choice B:** This is a forward difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t^2`. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (A forward difference makes use of the point itself, t_n, and a point *forward* in time, t_{n+1}. This is not the case here: we use points to the left and right, and the derivative is approximated in the center point. Also, a forward difference would not have an error \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2).)`

**Choice C:** This is a centered difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t^4`. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (It is centered, but the error is only \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2).)`

**Choice D:** This is a Backward Euler finite difference with error proportional to :math:`\Delta t`. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (Since we use the points t_{n+1} and t_n when constructing the difference at t_{n+1/2}, the derivative is in the *center* of the two points, and the difference is therefore a *centered* difference. A backward difference, or Backward Euler difference, would use t_{n+1/2} in this case and some point t_{n-1/2} *backward* in time.)`

Exercise 34: The :math:`\theta` rule
------------------------------------

.. --- previous heading type: exercise



.. begin quiz



**Question:** Why is the :math:`\theta`-rule a convenient method? For example, :math:`u'=-au` can
be solved by

.. math::
         \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -a (\theta u^{n+1} + (1-\theta) u^{n})


**Choice A:** It is more accurate than the Forward Euler and Backward Euler schemes. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (This is true, but only if \theta =1/2. Otherwise, it has the same accuracy as the Forward and Backward Euler schemes.)`

**Choice B:** It is easier to implement than, e.g., the Forward and Backward Euler schemes. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (The formula has slightly more complexity than the Forward and Backward Euler schemes, but cannot be said to be easier to implement - all of them are very simple formulas to program.)`

**Choice C:** It offers the Forward and Backward Euler schemes, the Crank-Nicolson scheme, and more variants in a single formula. :abbr:`? (Right!)` :abbr:`# (Yes, this is the advantage.)`

**Choice D:** It can be used for other equations than :math:`u'=-au`. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (True, but that is true for almost all other finite difference schemes too.)`

Exercise 35: What is the problem with this program?
---------------------------------------------------

.. --- previous heading type: exercise



.. begin quiz



**Question:** We want to solve

.. math::
         u ' = -au, \quad u(0)=1, 

by a Forward Euler scheme,

.. math::
         u^{n+1} = u^n - a\Delta t\, u^n,

and the following program

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        u = zeros(10)
        u[0] = 1
        dt = 0.1
        for i in range(10):
            u[i+1] = u[i] - dt*a*u[n]

What is the major problem with this program?


**Choice A:** ``from numpy import *`` is not recommended; one should import explicitly the functions needed or do ``import numpy as np``. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (True, these are recommended rules, but it is not a problem to do the "star import": it is legal and convenient.)`

**Choice B:** The program aborts with a ``NameError``. :abbr:`? (Right!)` :abbr:`# (True, a is not defined. This is the only reason why one cannot execute the program.)`

**Choice C:** The program is "flat". It should be wrapped in a function ``solver(U0, dt, N, a)``. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (That is definitely a good idea, but it is not a major problem for computing the solution of the differential equation.)`

**Choice D:** The scheme is unstable! :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (Actually, this can be true. Since a is not defined, it may happen that dt=0.1 is a too long time step for the stability restrictions of the Forward Euler method for this differential equation. We need \Delta t\leq 1/a. However, the answer is wrong in the sense that this *potential* instability is not the major problem with the program - it is a bigger problem that a is not defined.)`

Exercise 36: Is the solution correct?
-------------------------------------

.. --- previous heading type: exercise



.. begin quiz



**Question:** You have solved :math:`u'=-au` by the Crank-Nicolson scheme and tested
your program thoroughly. Suddenly you run the program with :math:`I=1`, :math:`a=10`, :math:`T=1`, and :math:`\Delta t=0.225`. You get somewhat unexpected results:

.. figure:: CN_osc.png
   :width: 500

The results are unexpected because we know the exact solution should be
monotone and decreasing, while this numerical solution also shows an
increasing stage. What is the problem?


**Choice A:** The program is not tested well enough - yet another bug is there. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (No, this computation is in fact correct - numerically.)`

**Choice B:** The numerical solution method is more general than the analytical one,
and this is an example where the solution can increase, but the analytical
solution technique is not capable of dealing with this situation. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (The analytical solution u(t)=Ie^{-at} covers all possible cases.)`

**Choice C:** The time step is too large and cause an instability in the form of non-physical oscillations. :abbr:`? (Right!)` :abbr:`# (True. One needs \Delta t \leq 2/a = 0.2 in this case to avoid oscillations.)`

**Choice D:** The Crank-Nicolson scheme is unconditionally stable and can be used with all time-step sizes, but the problem here is that round-off errors due to a "too large" :math:`a` (10, not around 1) accumulate to the effect seen in the plot. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (1: The first part is true if unconditionally stable means that the solution is bounded and decays with time, but one may also argue that oscillations, which are non-physical, are a kind of instability, and these occur if \Delta t >2/a. 2: Round-off errors are *very* small in this problem, compared to the discretization errors, and cannot cause an oscillating solution.)`

.. _decay:quiz:testfunc:

Exercise 37: Is this a proper test function?
--------------------------------------------

.. --- previous heading type: exercise



.. begin quiz



**Question:** Suppose we have some function ``compute`` that we want to test. We construct
a unit test and implement an associated test function (according to the
rules for test functions in the nose or pytest test frameworks):

.. code-block:: python

        def test_compute(n):
            expected = (n**2)/4.5 - 1
            computed = compute(n)
            assert expected != computed

The question is if this test function can be used as is or if improvements
must be implemented.


**Choice A:** One should use special assert functions from ``nose.tools``, here ``nose.tools.assert_almost_equal``. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (It is true that an "almost equal" type of assert function is appropriate, but there is nothing in the rules that requires use of special assert functions. The requirement is that an AssertionError is raised if the test fails. That is done by a plain assert as used here.)`

**Choice B:** One cannot test ``compute(n)`` for only one ``n`` value. Many are required for good evidence that the function works. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (This depends on what is inside compute. If it has several branches depending on the value of n, one must test for a visit to each branch, which requires multiple n values, but if it is a formula (the test might indicate so), one value can be sufficient.)`

**Choice C:** The test function does not test ``expected != computed`` with a tolerance
and the ``n`` parameter cannot be an argument. :abbr:`? (Right!)` :abbr:`# (The formula for expected indicates that this is a real number that is subject to potential round-off errors, so one should use a tolerance: abs(expected - computed) < 1E-14. Also, test functions should never take arguments.)`

**Choice D:** The ``assert`` statement also needs a message explaining what is wrong when the test fails. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (This is always a good idea, but not a requirement.)`

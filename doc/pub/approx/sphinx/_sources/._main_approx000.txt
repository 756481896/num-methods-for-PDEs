**PRELIMINARY VERSION**

The finite element method is a powerful tool for solving partial differential
equations. The method can easily deal with complex geometries and
higher-order approximations of the solution.  Below is a
two-dimensional domain with a
non-trivial geometry.

The idea of the finite element method is to divide the domain into triangles
(elements) and seek a polynomial approximations to the unknown
functions on each triangle. The method glues these piecewise
approximations together to find a global solution.  Linear and
quadratic polynomials over the triangles are particularly popular,
because of their mathematical simplicity, but higher-degree polynomials
are advantageous to create very computationally efficient methods.
The reason for using triangles is that they can easily approximate geometrically
complicated domains, but quadrilateral elements and boxes in 3D are also
widely used.
